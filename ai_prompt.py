        2. Must reflect the **caller‚Äôs main intent**.
        3. Avoid vague terms like `"Discussion"` or `"Phone Call"` unless truly no purpose is found.

    ]

- **CallType** ‚Äì [
    ### üìû CallType Rules:
        Determine the **direction of the call** based only on transcript content.
        Possible values:
                - `"Incoming"` ‚Äì Caller initiates contact (e.g., asking about service, test drive, insurance, etc.)
                - `"Outgoing"` ‚Äì Agent initiates contact (e.g., follow-up, reminder, promotional, verification, feedback)
                
        Guidelines:
                1. If the **caller starts by asking something**, it's likely **Incoming**
                - e.g., "Is this Honda?", "I want to ask about service"
                2. If the **agent begins with a greeting** or confirmation and drives the conversation, it's likely **Outgoing**
                - e.g., "Good morning sir, I'm calling from Victory Honda", "Did you receive our message?"
                
        Additional hints:
                - Outgoing calls often include references to:
                    - feedback, reminders, insurance follow-ups, past bookings
                    - scheduled service reminders, offer notifications
                    
                - Incoming calls often mention:
                    - general inquiries, service needs, vehicle info, test drives
                    
        If it's completely ambiguous or unclear, return:
        ```json
            "CallType": "Unclear"

            ---
            
            ‚úÖ Examples:

     ---‚úÖ Use one of the following standard values:
                - `"Good resolution"` ‚Äî Agent fully addressed the issue, gave clear steps or closure

    3. Avoid filler like "Hello", "How are you?", or repeated sentences
    4. If either party provides a key data point (e.g., car number, name, date), include it
